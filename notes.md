# In-progress Notes

## Other Objects/Obstacles
- [x] moveable blocks
- [ ] holes that the player can pass only when you move a block over it
- [ ] infinite holes that make a block disappear
- [ ] moving (random) creature blocks ("Randoms")
- [ ] moving (either up/down) blocks that change direction when button is pressed ("UpDowns")

## Puzzles
- [ ] move blocks to trap "Randoms" in specific area zone
- [ ] move "UpDowns" to specific square/zone


## Other ideas
* start with one square, increase size of grid as game progresses
* have different game stages
