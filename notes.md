# In-progress Notes

## Other Objects/Obstacles
- [x] moveable blocks
- [ ] holes that the player can pass only when you move a block over it
- [ ] infinite holes that make a block disappear
- [x] moving (random) creature blocks ("Randos")
  * Not moving is an option for randomized movement. Keep or delete?
- [ ] moving (either up/down) blocks that change direction when button is pressed ("UpDowns")
* Finish tiles
  - [ ] player can land on finish tile
  - [ ] brings you to next stage in game

## Puzzles
- [ ] escape the grid/perimeter (or to a finish tile)
- [ ] move blocks to trap "Randoms" in specific area zone
- [ ] move "UpDowns" to specific square/zone
- [ ] color-coordinate different colored moveable blocks to their color zone

## Other ideas
* start with one square, increase size of grid as game progresses
* have different game stages with different tasks
