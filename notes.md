# In-progress Notes

## Game Design
- [ ] Individualize each stage: name, instructions, initial settings

## Interface
- [ ] Instructions for stage/game
- [ ] Key/legend for color types
- [ ] Stage accomplished notification

## Creatures
- [x] Goombas: moveable blocks
- [x] Randos: moving (random) creature blocks
  * Not moving is an option for randomized movement. Keep or delete?
- [ ] UpDowns: moving (either up/down) blocks that change direction when button is pressed

## Objects/Obstacles
- [ ] Holes that the player can pass only when you move a block over it
- [x] BlackHoles: infinite holes that make a block disappear
* Finish tiles
  - [x] Player can land on finish tile
  - [ ] Brings you to next stage in game

## Puzzles
- [ ] escape the grid/perimeter (or to a finish tile)
- [ ] trap Randos in specific area/zone (by moving Goombas)
  * might be too difficult
- [ ] trap UpDowns in specific area/zone/square (by moving into direction-change toggle squares)
- [ ] push colored Goombas to color zone
- [x] push Goombas into BlackHoles to clear board (similar to above, but Goomba will disappear)

## Other ideas
* start with one square, increase size of grid as game progresses
* have different game stages with different tasks
